+ use wifi direct hostname on android (how to find/access value ?) as device name
+ create config file (Android only) with dir values etc, when 1st time / does not exist
+ to edit config:
  a) GET/PUT http services, through simple go app on PC, manually edit file
  b) web form on androidPush http server, manually edit file (cf web server tut, 'blog')
  c) Go PC app with GUI
  nb: config edition does not happen often .. K.I.S.S !?
+ Android app: 
  + deal with app life stages (start,sleep etc ?)
  -> the http & mppq servers keep running after we exit the main activity
    ? have a 'press back again to exit' thing ?
    ? have a Close button ?
    ? auto close after push completed?
