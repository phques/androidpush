AndroidPush
PC & Android apps to 'push' files from PC to Android,
through *local* network (ie- normally, wi-fi)

Using known 'public' directories on Android (ie Downloads, Music, Pictures etc)

2013-07-08 : note that this idea came from the fact that I could not use my Galaxy S3 with MTP (USB cable) on Linux !
             the current Linux version I am using now supports this. So this project lost it's purpose ;-)
