android file pusher

AndroidClient
-------------
+ preferences for udpPort !?
+ handles one file at time right now,
  + autom. go into GO mode (no button ;-p)
  and loop after done
+ call media scanner after download, need Context for this
+ some GUI progress about download
+ will prob need to use different thread technique .. service of some sort


FileServer
----------

+ some GUI ?
  + GUI just front-end to console app ? (not so nice on Windows)
  + choice of dest dir type (music, movies etc)
  + D&D of files, file, dir ?
  or FileSelect dlg (but would need 2 diff dlg: file or dir ?)
  + ask user to select dest subDir : copy src dir by default, 
    user then can delete part no required
    + or have a 'root' dir selected, that part is auto removed from filepath
    ie: root=/home/kwez/Music
        file=/home/kwez/Music/PatM/Fusion
        result subDir=PatM/Fusion

+ actually just need some 'shortcuts', using the 'rootdir' idea !
+ new cmdline param rootdir,
+ could support directory, do all files (what if subdirs !!?? --recursive opt)
then drag n drop stuff on it ! (can we pass dropped stuff as param in Gnome? (no!) )
    then shortcut "pushMusic" =
      fileServer --destDirType=music --rootDir=pathToMusicOnThisPC --file=$1 .. other params

----------------

+ pull/sendTo !!!!

pull ideas:
+ add ShareAS service (???)
+ how to decide where to save on the PC ??
